ABSTRACT="In this paper, the problem of cell association between small base stations
(SBSs) and users in dense wireless networks is studied using artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques. The problem is formulated as a mean-field
game in which the users' goal is to maximize their data rate by exploiting
local data and the data available at neighboring users via an imitation
process. Such a learning process prevents the users from exchanging their
data directly via the cellular network's limited backhaul links and, thus,
allows them to improve their cell association policy collaboratively with
minimum computing. To solve this problem, a deep reinforcement learning
algorithm is proposed that enables the users to predict their reward
function using a neural network whose input is the SBSs selected by
neighboring users and the local data of the considered user. Simulation
results show that the proposed imitation-based mechanism for cell
association converges faster than the cell association without imitation to
the optimal solution."
