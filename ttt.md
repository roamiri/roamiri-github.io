I am a PhD student at the [Wireless@VT](https://wireless.vt.edu/) group,  [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). My research is supervised by [Dr. Harpreet S. Dhillon](http://www.dhillon.ece.vt.edu/). My research interst is developing mathematically tractable models of wireless networks using the tools of stochastic geometry. These models are used to derive analytical expressions (sometimes in closed-form) of the key performance metrics (like *coverage* and *data rate*). From stochastic geometry aspects, I have worked with *cluster processes* which closely replicates the *hotspots* in a network with high data demands. I am also working on modeling and analysis of *millimeter wave integrated access and backhaul networks* which is a revolutionary design paradigm of the emerging 5G cellular networks. 
 In summer 2018, I was an intern in [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) where I  explored the beam-tracking performances of mm-wave base stations in urban enviromentments.

Alongside my research, I am a photography-enthusiast. I love to spend time reading and talking about cameras, lights and post-processing. Here's a link to my small gallery.
