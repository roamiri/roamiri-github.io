Instructions for bulding the project:

run "bundle exec jekyll serve" in terminal.



For few more steps backward, these are the commands I executed.

git init website-minimal
ls Gemfile ## check whether there is a Gemfile
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

The instructions were obtained from ---
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

Need to check again to enable automatic updates while the site is up and running.

Status:

-Fonts are super flexible.
For changing fonts, colors of h and p attribute, just go to
assets⁩ ▸ ⁨themes⁩ ▸ ⁨twitter⁩ ▸ ⁨css⁩/kbroman.css

Also add the font family in default.html

- Still can not figure out how to change the navigation bar styling. 
 Last update: changing .navbar didn't work in any of the css files.
