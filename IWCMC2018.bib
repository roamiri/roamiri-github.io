ABSTRACT="In this paper, a distributed, minimum overhead power control algorithm for
underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs) having multiple primary and
secondary users is proposed. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative
game and a learning algorithm is proposed for optimizing the power
allocation of secondary users. In the considered network, secondary users
(SUs) do not have full information on the interference and power control
strategies of other SUs. As a result, they update their strategy using a
simple feedback from the primary user base station that provides the total
interference. Although there is no cooperation among secondary users, it is
shown that, under incomplete information, the proposed learning algorithm
converges to the strategy of the players in the Nash equilibrium of the
complete information case. The Nash equilibrium point is analytically
derived and it is shown that, despite the fact that each user individually
tries to maximize its own payoff, at the end, the proposed algorithm will
converge to the complete information game Nash equilibrium point. It is
also demonstrated that because of the slotted time assumption of the
algorithm, it will be capable of adapting to a time-varying environment if
some conditions on the SUs' processing power are satisfied. Simulation
results are then used to corroborate the analytical derivations."
